import { Client } from "discord.js";

const nodes = [{
    name: "main",
    address: "localhost",
    password: "youshallnotpass",
    port: 2333,
}];

const client = new Client();
const manager = new Manager(nodes, {
  send: (guildId, packet) => {
    const guild = client.guilds.cache.get(guildId);
    if (guild) return guild.shard.send(packet);
    return;
  },
});

client.on("ready", () => manager.init(client.user.id));
client.ws.on("VOICE_SERVER_UPDATE", (pk) => manager.serverUpdate(pk));
client.ws.on("VOICE_STATE_UPDATE", (pk) => manager.stateUpdate(pk));
```

### Joining & Leaving

```ts
const player = manager.summonPlayer("696355996657909790");

await player.connect("696359398708215848", { deaf: true });
